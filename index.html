      	I have a large amount of experience with React and other abstractions of the raw web code. I also have dealt with graphics abstractions in Unity and other game engines. However, my days of writing the raw HTML, CSS, and JS are long gone. This project made me remember why: modularization is very difficult when working with pages as a whole. When working with an abstraction modularization comes easily because each component can be its own file, but the only option for this in raw HTML would be iframes or similar.

	This lack of modularization extends to the THREE.JS the rendering it provided does not allow for easy modularization. I am used to graphics toolkit where every item is separate, so method used by THREE is a little strange. However, it is good getting experience with this as a hope to develop my own game engine.
